        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This sandwich was invented in New York City and is kind of like a cheesesteak. Toppings, if any, are optional. Usually this sandwich is cooked on a griddle but a skillet can be used at home.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds (80/20) ground beef</li>
            <li> 1 white onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 jar adobo seasoning</li>
            <li> 6 hoagie rolls</li>
            <li>12 slices American cheese</li>
            <li>1 bag shredded iceberg lettuce</li>
            <li>Any other toppings as desired (mayo, tomatoes, etc)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the ground beef over medium-high heat. You can also use hamburger patties to have evenly measured portions. I use about 2 hamburgers per sandwich.</li>
            <li>Add the onions and sprinkle an generous amount of adobo seasoning on the beef.</li>
            <li>Cook for another 4 minutes until the onions are softened on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add two slices of cheese over top of the meat and onions.</li>
            <li>As the meat is cooked through and getting semi-crispy, toast the buns for a minute or so.</li>
            <li>Chop the meat and vegetable mixture up, then scoop and place into the bun. I suggest a thick bun that is toasted to give enough structure to hold the sandwich contents.</li>
            
        </ol>
