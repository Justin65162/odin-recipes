        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sweet potato pie is a fairly easy and delicious dessert to make. The key to making it properly is to stop mixing every so often to remove the "strings" from the sweet potatoes. Do this multiple times until only a few strands are stuck to the mixer. This helps keep the pie smooth in texture. Also the pie filling should be sweet like ice cream prior to baking for the best taste.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound of sweet potatoes</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of butter</li>
            <li>1 cup of white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of milk</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 pie crust (9 inch)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
