        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a recipe for probably the only edible thing I was served while in the military. Wait, wait, don't leave! It's actually really delicious, I promise. You can also make this way fancier by using actual soba noodles or more variety to the vegetables. This is the basic version that is cheap and easy to make.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>1 chopped onion</li>
            <li>1-2 chopped green peppers</li>
            <li>2/3 cup of water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pound cooked spaghetti noodles</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped green onions</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Brown the beef in a skillet.</li>
            <li>Add the onion and peppers once the beef is almost done cooking.</li>
            <li>Keep cooking and stirring until the meat is cooked well-done and the vegetables are tender.</li>
            <li>Mix the water, soy sauce, garlic powder, ginger, and pepper then add to the meat and vegetables. Stir well.</li>
            <li>Add the noodles and green onions. Mix well.</li>
        </ol>
